We would understand at the end of article how the Underwater Image Formation model works alongside with the corresponding implementation on python. You should know that all the information is taken from these two papers.

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. 

```python
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
  return
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
