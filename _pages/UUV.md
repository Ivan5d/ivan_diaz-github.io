# Introduction
VantTec's UUV is a project at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. After a long stay in Germany, I came back to Mexico and took over the UUV, which faced significant challenges, including my lack of familiarity with underwater robotics. After a year of team effort of more than 16 undergraduate students, the UUV became a reality and is ready to continue the legacy of previous generations. This are the first results entirely done by my administration:

# Software/Localization
The UUV is based on ROS Noetic and it is aimed to contain the next localization scheme.

## Contribution
There are missing sensors that make impossible to work on a localization scheme. For this reason, we are working at the moment to supply the missing sensores with a camera, specifically aiming an underwater backscatter removal and image color enhancing, as well as optical flow in the underwater application.

# Vision
At the moment, we are working with synthetic data, i.e., rendered images, to feed object detector models. This is done using a pipeline with diffusion models. Given that we want the image to be already annotated, then we are using ControlNet neural network architecture. The result is shown next.

## Contribution
At the moment we are conditionining the diffusion process to incorporate the actual coefficients of the underwater image formation model, i.e., attenuation coefficients.
