excerpt: Here is a list of the projects that I've been working on, as well as the links to the publicly available source codes.

### Computer Vision
[Synthetic Data Generation](https://github.com/vanttec/vanttec_synthdata): Procedural pipeline implementation for synthetic image renderization to feed segmentation and object detection models used within autonomous vehicles. (In progress: this is an improvement to my work at Evocortex)

Image classification for glaucoma (eyes disease): image classfication using firstly a segmentation model and secondly a classification model for glaucoma diagnosis. Project for the [Hospital de la Ceguera](https://apec.org.mx/)

### Underwater Autonomous Vehicle (UUV)
[UUV's Repository and Gazebo Simulation](https://github.com/vanttec/vanttec_uuv): The repo is based on Robotic Operating System (ROS), but student generations has passed and the repo is broken on different ROS, python versions and branches. In charge of solve all issues for integration. In addition, the gazebo implementation for testing underwater robot's sensors and algorithms is missing key sensors such as the sonar. (In progress) 

### Next project
**Real-time image color correction for underwater applications:** The UUV can't rely more on its camera, because there are attenuation coefficients on the water. The image color correction based on the image underwater model requires a couple of seconds and it is unfeasible for a real-time application.

[Explainable AI for Synthetic Data Generation](https://github.com/Ivan5d/AI_Synthdata): Implementation of XAI methods for visualizing the object detection flaws, with a focus on improving the synthetic data generation strategy. (This is an improvement to my work at Evocortex)
