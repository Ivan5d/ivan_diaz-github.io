### Computer Vision
[Synthetic Data Generation](https://github.com/vanttec/vanttec_synthdata): Procedural pipeline implementation for synthetic image renderization to feed segmentation and object detection models used within autonomous vehicles.

[Explainable AI for Synthetic Data Generation](https://github.com/Ivan5d/AI_Synthdata): Implementation of XAI methods for visualizing the object detection flaws, with a focus on improving the synthetic data generation strategy.

[Object Detection for eyes diseases (glaucoma)](/glaucoma): Analysis and training of different neural network models for glaucoma diagnosis.

## Underwater Autonomous Vehicle (UUV)
[Gazebo simulation](https://github.com/vanttec/vanttec_sim): Gazebo implementation for testing underwater robot's sensors and algorithms.

[ROS repository of the UUV](https://github.com/vanttec/vanttec_uuv): Robotic Operating System (ROS) repository of the UUV.

## Next projects
