### Computer Vision
[Synthetic Data Generation](/projects/Synthetic/): Autonomous vehicles rely on annotations for object detection and image segmentation task. This pipeline tries to solve this problem, where you use as an input a CAD model and the output is a realistic image with its annotation. (In progress: this is an improvement to my work at Evocortex)

*Open source github repo*: [vanttec_synthdata](https://github.com/vanttec/vanttec_synthdata)

Image classification for glaucoma (eyes disease): image classfication using firstly a segmentation model and secondly a classification model for glaucoma diagnosis. Project for the [Hospital de la Ceguera](https://apec.org.mx/)

### Autonomous Vehicle
[Unmanned Underwater Vehicle](/projects/UUV/): VantTec’s UUV is a project at the Tecnológico de Monterrey University. I lead the UUV project one year before my engineering graduation and opened up multiple projects in parallel. The results here shown were made entirely during my time.

*Open source github repo*: [vanttec_uuv](https://github.com/vanttec/vanttec_uuv)

### Next project
**Real-time image enhancement for underwater applications:** The UUV can't rely more on its camera, because the water's attenuation coefficients. Methods such as [Sea-Thru](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Akkaynak_Sea-Thru_A_Method_for_Removing_Water_From_Underwater_Images_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf) require a couple of seconds and a depth map which makes it unfeasible for a real-time application.

[Explainable AI for Synthetic Data Generation](https://github.com/Ivan5d/AI_Synthdata): Implementation of XAI methods for visualizing the object detection flaws, with a focus on improving the synthetic data generation strategy. (This is an improvement to my work at Evocortex)
