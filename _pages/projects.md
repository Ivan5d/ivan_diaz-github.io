### Computer Vision
[Synthetic Data Generation](https://github.com/vanttec/vanttec_synthdata): Procedural pipeline implementation for synthetic image generation to feed segmentation and object detection models used  within the autonomous vehicles field.

[Explainable AI for Synthetic Data Generation](https://github.com/Ivan5d/AI_Synthdata): Implementation of XAI methods for visualizing the object detection flaws, with a focus on improving the synthetic data generation strategy.

**Object Detection for eyes diseases (glaucoma):** Analysis and training of different neural network models for glaucoma diagnosis.

**(Next project) Realtime underwater image enhancement using the underwater image formation model**.

## Underwater Autonomous Vehicle (UUV)
[Gazebo robotics simulation for an UUV](https://github.com/vanttec/vanttec_sim): Gazebo implementation for an underwater robot.

[ROS repository of the UUV](https://github.com/vanttec/vanttec_uuv): Robotic Operating System (ROS) repository of the UUV.

**(Next project) Zero shot learning for a gripper system:** Isaac Gym usage for zero shot learning for a gripper system mounted on the UUV.
